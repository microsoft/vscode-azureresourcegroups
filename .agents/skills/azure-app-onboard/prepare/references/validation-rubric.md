# Validation Rubric

Run all 4 dimensions before writing `prepare-plan.json`. All must pass — a failure in any dimension triggers the [Error Handling](../SKILL.md#error-handling) procedures.

## Dimensions

| Dimension | Pass Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Goal Alignment** | Every `context.json.intent` field reflected in service/SKU choice. No orphaned services (every service maps to a component or supporting role). `overrides[]` honored. |
| **WAF Alignment** | **Cost:** SKU matches budget; alternatives document cost tradeoffs. **Reliability:** Production plans include zone-redundant SKUs, GRS storage. **Security:** Managed identity + Key Vault; private endpoints where budget allows. **Ops:** Log Analytics + App Insights included. **Performance:** SKU right-sized to scale — no over/under-provisioning. See [Azure WAF Service Guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/service-guides/) for per-service alignment. |
| **Dependency Completeness** | Every service has its dependencies present (Container Apps → Log Analytics; SQL → Key Vault for connection strings; App Service → App Insights for monitoring; all services → Managed Identity for auth). Cross-service references consistent (App Insights → Log Analytics workspace). |
| **Deployment Viability** | SKUs exist in target region (validated by quota/region check). No policy-blocked resources. Resource names conform to Azure naming rules. Quota sufficient or flagged with remediation. No conflicting configs (free-tier SKU with paid-only features). |

## Applying

- **During plan creation (steps 3–7):** Use Goal Alignment and WAF Alignment as selection criteria. Use Dependency Completeness as cross-check after mapping.
- **Before writing (step 10):** Run all 4 as validation pass. Deployment Viability catches issues that surface after quota/naming.
- **On failure:** Fix inline via the [Error Handling](../SKILL.md#error-handling) procedures. Document tradeoffs (e.g., WAF Reliability vs cost-optimized budget) in `assumptions[]`.
